# mangapin
Mangapin is a personal library of manga recommendations designed and built by Sheena Gonzalez, as a coding practice to learn Vue. This is a quick mini project where I focused more on functionality, the rest of the features are left unfinished.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
